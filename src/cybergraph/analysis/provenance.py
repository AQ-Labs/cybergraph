"""How was this string value constructed?

Answers one question and knows nothing about security:

``LITERAL``   a constant, or a name bound only to constants
``COMPOSED``  assembled here by ``+``, an f-string, ``%``, ``.format()`` or ``.join()``
``OPAQUE``    from a call, a parameter, or anything not tracked

Orthogonal to taint, which ``analysis.python._add_python_dataflows`` tracks
separately. Keeping the axes apart is what lets ``f"... ORDER BY {allowlisted}"``
be COMPOSED *and* clean. Collapsing them forces a false choice between a false
positive on dynamic-but-safe queries and a provenance label that is a lie.
